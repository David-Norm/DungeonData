If you need to change your user/password for the database connection to 
test the front end you can change that in the instance fields in the DatabaseConnection
class (DB_USER, DB_PASS, and DB_URL). When looking at the URL, there is a "dungeondata"
right after "localhost:3306/", you will need to change this to the name of the database 
if it is changed for any reason. 
Thank you for a fun and informative quarter!
